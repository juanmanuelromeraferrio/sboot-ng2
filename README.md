# sboot-ng2

This is a model project that use angular 2 and spring boot to create a web application.

I use the [JDriven's Tutorial  - Angular2 and Spring Boot: Getting Started](https://blog.jdriven.com/2016/12/angular2-spring-boot-getting-started/)
and the [Angular Tour of Heroes's Tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/) to create it.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.26.

## Build & Run

```sh
$ mvn clean install
$ cd backend
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`.
